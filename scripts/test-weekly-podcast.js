    const mockScript = `Welcome to the Dekr Weekly Community Podcast! I'm your host, and what an absolutely incredible week it's been in the markets and here in our amazing community.

Let me start with the big picture - this week has been like watching a master chef create a perfect dish. All the ingredients came together beautifully, and our community of 1,250+ smart traders absolutely crushed it.

Leading the charge this week is Alex Chen, who delivered a stunning 12.5% return with an 85.2% accuracy rate. That's not just luck, folks - that's the power of collective intelligence in action.

Speaking of intelligence, let's talk about what moved the markets this week. Apple (AAPL) was the talk of the town, with a stellar +3.2% performance. Think of it like a well-orchestrated symphony - when the fundamentals align with market sentiment, magic happens.

The news cycle this week was dominated by "Tech Stocks Rally on Strong Earnings" - and here's what's really interesting about this story. It's not just about the headline, it's about how our community saw it coming. We're talking about 78% accuracy in predicting market movements this week alone.

Here's where it gets exciting - our community isn't just following the markets, we're anticipating them. Like a skilled chess player thinking three moves ahead, our members are building strategies that account for multiple scenarios.

The market sentiment this week has been bullish, and here's the beautiful thing about sentiment - it's like the weather. You can't control it, but you can prepare for it. Our community has been doing exactly that, positioning themselves for exactly the scenarios that unfolded.

Let me share something that really gets me excited - we had 2 new members join our community this week. Welcome to the family! You've just joined a group of people who don't just trade - they think, they learn, they adapt.

Here's what I want you to take away from this week's performance: we're not just building a trading community here, we're building a learning community. We're building a place where smart people can share ideas, test strategies, and yes, make money together.

The markets will do what the markets do - they'll go up, they'll go down, they'll make you question everything you thought you knew. But this community? This community is different. This community is thinking, learning, and adapting.

And that, my friends, is how you build wealth that lasts.

Looking ahead to next week, keep your eyes on the economic calendar. We've got some key data releases coming up that could create opportunities for those who are prepared. Remember, in the world of smart investing, preparation beats prediction every time.

Until next week, keep your charts close and your stop-losses closer. This is your Dekr Weekly Community Podcast, and I'll see you on the trading floor. Thanks for being part of the Dekr community - that's D-E-K-R, pronounced "Decker" - where smart traders come to learn, share, and succeed together.`;
