# Figma to React Native - Cursor Prompt Templates

## üöÄ Quick Start Prompt
```
I've just converted a Figma frame to React Native using the automated scripts. Please:

1. Review the generated component in figma-exports/
2. Integrate it into my app structure at [SPECIFY_PATH]
3. Fix any styling issues to match the Figma design exactly
4. Add proper TypeScript types and interfaces
5. Ensure it follows React Native best practices
6. Add any missing functionality (onPress handlers, navigation, etc.)

The component should be production-ready and match the Figma design as closely as possible.
```

## üé® Styling Refinement Prompt
```
The Figma conversion created a component but the styling needs refinement. Please:

- Adjust spacing, padding, and margins to match the design exactly
- Fix any color or typography discrepancies
- Optimize for different screen sizes (responsive design)
- Add proper flexbox layout if needed
- Ensure proper contrast and accessibility
- Handle dark/light mode if applicable

Component location: figma-exports/[COMPONENT_NAME].tsx
```

## ‚ö° Functionality Addition Prompt
```
The Figma component is visually correct but needs functionality. Please add:

- Touch interactions and proper onPress handlers
- Navigation to other screens
- State management for dynamic content
- Loading states and error handling
- Proper accessibility features (accessibilityLabel, accessibilityHint)
- Form validation if it's an input component
- Animation and transitions where appropriate

Component: figma-exports/[COMPONENT_NAME].tsx
```
